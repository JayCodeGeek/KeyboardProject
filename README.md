# KeyboardProject

Created this project to learn more about event listeners and especially about keydown event.
In this project I've designed a keyboard in which its keys can be clicked and pressed.
The clicked or pressed key is diplayed on the screen. I've added the operation of special keys such as delete, backspace, spacebar, enter, capslock etc.
